### 5.1 and 5.2 Notes

**5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Innovations**

- Accelerometers
- - Part of the automobile industry; chip that detects acceleration, motion and orientation
- - Used for Airbag deployment and lateral movement detection
- - Wii controllers, iPhones and Drones use these
- - - Benefits : Deliveries, finding lost people
- - - Harm: Flying in unregulated zones, privacy concerns
- 3D printers
- - Open-source software
- - Present in schools and homes
- - New classes developed for 3D printing
- - Can create shoes, jewelry, etc.

**5.2**

- The internet originally made for scientists
- - Now can lead to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety
- - COMPUTING INNOVATIONS CAN BE USED IN WAYS OTHER THAN INTENDED BY CREATORS
- Microtransactions
- - Any purchase made in a game
- - Typically in free games/apps
- - These can cause a casino effect because you donâ€™t realize how much money you are spending
- - Loot boxes GAMBLING


### 5.1
**Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing**

Three benificial effects of computing could be making education more acessable, allowing the spread of information more easiliy, and creating jobs centered around computing. On the other hand, three harmful effects of computing could be information leaks, the quick spread of false information, and online scamming. 

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

Dopamine issues are a real thing and with computing, these issues are becoming much more widespread. Personally, I struggle with procrastination in school due to social media apps such as Tik Tok, Snapchat, and Instagram. These apps give me a rush of dopamine so instead of gettin gmy work done I continue to scroll untill the last minuite. 

### 5.2
**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

Someone could empowe themself in a digital world through making connections, learning new information, and spreading their ideas. Computing and the digitial world has made a lot of these things much easier. 

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Someone that is empowered could help someone that is not empowered by sharing information. At Del Norte, I could help a classmate that is struggling by providing them with my solutions to their issues. For example, in computer science, I could show my classmates how I solved a problem.

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

I belive red tape is blocking digital empowerment. At Del Norte we might not experience this as much as we are in a very privaleged position when is comes to technology, but in other places many students don't have the same acess to computers, therefore they can not be digitally empowered.

### 5.3 and 5.4 Notes

**5.3**

- Effects and Digital Divide
- - Differing access to computing devices and the internet
- - - Socioeconomic groups
- - - Geographic characteristics
- - - Demographic characteristics
- - - Age
- - - Religion
- - - Between countries
- - - Protect government

**5.4**

- Library - A collection of functions you can use in your own program
- - Python libraries default
- - Imports are usually libraries

- Random Values
- - Computer able to generate a random value
- - Random (a,b)

- Simulations
- Algorithm 
- - You can make a simulation algorithm, churn data in, computer churns data out

### 5.3
**Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

No, the owner of the computer does not think this was intentional. He recognizes that this was most likley an oversight but wants to call out the company on their mistake. 

**How do you think this happened?**

I think this happened because HP didn't croudsource and test the feauture on different demographics/skintones.

**Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Should it be corrected?**

This could be harful as an entire group of people can not use a feature on the computer. I don't think HP intended for this to be harmful and exlude people, I belive this was most likley an accident. This feature should be corrected as soon as possible, it is unprofessional to make a mistale like this but it happens. 

**What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

To produce a better outcome, you should croudsource and test features will all sorts of people. 

### 5.4
**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

One croud source idea I have is getting everybodys favorite subject to find the most popular subject at our school. I could initiate this in our enviornment by setting up a database to hold all the information and having people insert their name and favorite subject. 

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

For Del Norte croudsourcing I could do something similar, with our final project, we could use croudsourcing to have people test the site on different computers and look for bugs.
